# CS 409 Final Project

In this project we create several sandboxes in parallel to streamline AI‑agent testing. So you could test your AI Agent in any forms you like, without actually harming your real social accounts and real world data. The sandboxes cover platforms such as Twitter, Gmail, and more. Refer to each directory’s README for usage instructions.
